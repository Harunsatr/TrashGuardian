Trash Attack is a video game coded in Python designed to teach elementary children about proper waste sorting. In this game, players control a bin to catch waste items falling from the sky. Though the types of waste are limited at first, more varieties are introduced as the game progresses. Ultimately, the player must learn how to sort a diverse selection of waste products into 3 bins at their disposal: garbage, compost, and recycling.
